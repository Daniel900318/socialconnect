                    <h2>It can be a bit scary to some, but we do love our kale</h2>
                    <p>Kale is the Queen of Green and we can’t get enough of it. Once confined to whole-foods stores and your local greengrocer, this leafy green is now available in all supermarkets, which is a result as it’s a nutrient powerhouse and really versatile.</p>
                    <p>Kale is rich in Iron, Chlorophyll, Vitamin K, Vitamin C, Beta-carotene, Potassium and Calcium. To put it in a #StupidlyHealthy way, it contains antioxidants that support your immune system and minerals which strengthen your bones, reduce blood pressure and lower the risk of heart disease.</p>
                    <p>We try to use kale as much possible in our daily meals and juices, which is why we use a handful and a half of it in our #GreenJuice. It’s hard getting the juice out of the fibrous stems and leaves but it’s well worth the hassle.</p>

                <div class="left-box-blog">
                    <p>Kale comes in a number of varieties, but we mostly use the curly kind. When juicing, use the whole of the stem and leaf as you don’t want to lose out on any of the good stuff. For salads, it’s best to finely shred or julienne the kale leaf as this helps make it a bit more tender when eating raw. A couple of salad producers&nbsp;(such as <a href="http://www.florettesalad.co.uk/recipe-category/baby-kale">Florette</a>) have started to sell pre-packed baby curly kale, a milder and more delicate salad base for the less hardcore kale fans.</p>
                    <p>We’ve got an awesome recipe for kale chips, which takes no time to prepare and is a properly healthy snack.</p>
                    <p>We’d love to see some pictures of your kale creations, just tag us in and use #StupidlyHealthy.</p>

                            <p>approx. 1/2 bunch of curly kale leaves</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or melted coconut oil</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>1 teaspoon garlic powder</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt or pink Himalayan sea salt</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Preheat oven to 150°C. Line a large rimmed baking tray with parchment paper.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Remove leaves from the stems of the kale and roughly tear it up into large pieces. Compost the stems (or freeze for smoothies). Wash and spin the leaves until thoroughly dry.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Add kale leaves into a large bowl. Massage in the oil until all the nooks and crannies are coated in oil. Now sprinkle on the spices/seasonings and toss to combine.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Spread out the kale onto the prepared baking tray into a single layer, being sure not to overcrowd the kale.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Bake for 10 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake for another 12-15 minutes more until the kale begins to firm up. The kale will look shrunken, but this is normal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Cool the kale on the sheet for 3 minutes before digging in. This really makes all the difference! Enjoy immediately as they lose their crispness with time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Replace the savoury seasonings with a bit of cinnamon and maple syrup if you’ve got a sweeter tooth.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
