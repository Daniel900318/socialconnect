                <div class="right-box-blog">
                    <p>We recently launched our super healthy and tasty cold pressed juices in the UK, and now it’s time to introduce you to what makes MOJU tick.</p>
                    <p>When not making the healthiest juices possible, we love having fun, getting&nbsp;active, and eating and drinking well – basically, our version of #StupidlyHealthy! It’s not about being superhuman (we certainly aren’t), it’s about getting out and doing the things that make you healthy and happy.</p>
                    <p>We’re going to introduce you to people that will inspire you to try something you’ve not done before, or to simply make small steps towards being a bit healthier and more active.</p>
                    <p>The MOJU Paper will also help to demystify and simplify some of the jargon associated with the health and fitness industries, which we think has got a little out of hand in recent years.</p>
                    <p>Between us we have pretty varied interests; from surfing, music to&nbsp;bizarre&nbsp;endurance challenges and beyond.&nbsp; So expect the weird and wonderful!</p>

                    <h2><a href="/blogs/news/70080389-moju-people">moju people</a></h2> We are proud to introduce you to a good mate of ours, Louis Browne. Louis is a personal trainer, but with a twist – he is also a Calisthenics expert, which in #StupidlyHealthy terms is using&nbsp;your body weight to get and stay fit.&nbsp;Louis will tell you about how easy (and inexpensive) it is to incorporate&nbsp;Calisthenics into your daily routine.&nbsp;He will also be offering out a few trade secrets along the way.</div>

                    <p>To kick off our ingredients series, we’re looking at the nutrient powerhouse that is kale, or as we like to call her, the Queen of Green. We'll be delving into our food and juice recipes and are always on the look out for new ways to make the most of&nbsp;our favourite veg and fruit. If you've got a recipe you would like featured on the MOJU Paper, drop us an email on aloha@mojudrinks.com</p>
