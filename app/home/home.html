        We started MOJU to make the healthiest and tastiest juices available to everyone.
        <br>Our juices are packed with vegetables and fruit, and never heat pasteurised which mean
        <br> they are a quick and convenient way to make a healthier choice and get the nutrients your body needs.
        <br>
        <br> You can find MOJU in stockists across London and through our online delivery service.

                We make super healthy juices, using more nutrient-rich veg than sugary fruit and we steer clear of corner-cutting purees, pulps & additives. And because we never, ever pasteurise, we make juice with more nutrients and more flavour. Meaning our juices are #StupidlyHealthy.

                    Cold pressing extracts up to 5 x more nutrients than traditional methods

                    We never pasteurise or 'cook' our juice as this destroys vitamins, minerals and enzymes. Instead we use pressure (HPP) to protect the nutrients and flavour

                    At least 4 portions of fruit and veg are pressed into each bottle, that’s an impressive 1/3 of a kilo

                We met at university, and fell into the kind of busy, corporate jobs that meant we had to wear suits and shiny shoes. Like most people nowadays, we were working long hours and leading hectic lives, so we started juicing at home to help stay healthy. Unable to find genuinely healthy juices elsewhere that didn’t bust our wallets, we ditched our jobs, determined to make our tastier and healthier juices available to everyone.

                MOJU began with tasting sessions at Charlie's mum's book club and, after gaining rave reviews, we started selling our juices at farmers' markets and festivals from the back of Charlie’s gran’s old VW Golf. The Golf was part delivery van, part office. Charlie zoomed around London making deliveries; parking outside Rich’s office for impromptu conference calls and high-powered business meetings in the boot.

                MOJU went from strength to strength and now we have Pamela – a Piaggio Ape van (more about her later) – and a proper office to call our own. We now have a range of convenient, cold pressed juices that mean real people, with naturally busy lives can get the good stuff they need to stay healthy and happy. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do.

                        Pamela, meet the internet. Internet, meet Pamela. You might see our Piaggio Ape van (named after Charlie’s gran, Pamela) zooming around, bringing our cold pressed juices to farmers markets, festivals, homes, offices, parks, anywhere really. Because we believe that cold pressed juice should be available to everyone, not just gym bunnies. We post updates from our travels and we always love to see pictures of you enjoying MOJU.
